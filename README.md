# User Login App using Auth0

This repository contains a user login app built using React and Auth0. The app allows users to authenticate using their email and password or using a third-party provider such as Google or Facebook.

## Getting Started

To use the app, clone or download the repository and run `npm install` and `npm start` to start the development server. The app can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Features

- The app includes a login form where users can enter their email and password to authenticate.
- The app allows users to authenticate using a third-party provider by clicking on the corresponding button.
- The app includes a logout button for users to log out of their account.
- The app displays a greeting message and the user's profile picture after they have logged in.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add additional features to the app such as:

- The ability for users to reset their password if they forget it.
- The ability to customize the appearance of the app, including the color and font.
- The ability to restrict access to certain pages or features based on the user's role or permissions.
